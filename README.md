# A Moron's Collection of Stable Diffusion Resources

I put these resouces together to assist friends of mine in setting up Voldy's Stable Diffusion GUI. Hopefully sharing them here assists a few others in both setting up and understanding this exciting, and rapidly developing, technology. If there's anything not touched on here that you're interested in learning about, let me know and I'll attempt a guide to the best of my ability. Similarly, if there is any knowledge that you're interested in sharing, send it my way and I'll be happy to integrate it into this resource center.
