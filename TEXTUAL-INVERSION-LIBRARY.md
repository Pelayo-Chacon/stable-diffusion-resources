# Textual Inversion Models

This is a small database of the textual inversion model (hopefully soon to be models) that I've run. If you're interested in submitting your own for inclusion, please feel free to reach out to me. All files are hosted here in `.zip` files containing the `.bin` since GitHub doesn't support hosting `.bin` files directly. I'll try to add images to accompany every model at some point, so you have an idea of what to expect.
