# A Moron's Stable Diffusion Resources

These are some of the best resources I've found for understanding how Stable Diffusion works, as well as how you can learn it to craft better prompts. If you come across anything good, please send it my way. I do mean to organize these better when I have the chance.

## Prompt Builders

[Takes an existing image and generates a prompt out of it. Works pretty well for a starting point.](https://replicate.com/methexis-inc/img2prompt)
